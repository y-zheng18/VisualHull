VisualHull:3D RGB reconstruction
======
3d reconstruction based on:
--
* PCA \
calculate normal vector of surface
* Poisson reconstruction \
reconstruct the surface

Improved algorithm:
--
* Octree \
  accelebrate the process of getting the model point
* BFS \
  accelebrate the process of getting the surface point
* RGB optimization\
  paint the model surface using the RGB pictures
  
Reconstruction result:
